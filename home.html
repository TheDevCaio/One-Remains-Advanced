  <li>1: The game is played on a board with holes arranged in a cross shape.</li>
  <br>
  <li>2: Initially, all the holes on the board are filled with pegs, except for the central hole.</li>
  <br>
  <li>3: The objective of the game is to eliminate as many pegs as possible by jumping over them with other pegs.</li>
  <br>
  <li>4: A peg can jump over another peg horizontally or vertically to an empty hole, and the jumped peg is removed from the board.</li>
  <br>
  <li>5: Only one peg must remain on the board, ideally in the central hole, for the player to win the game.</li>
  <br>
  <li>6: A valid move is when a peg jumps over another peg into an empty hole in a straight line (horizontally or vertically).</li>
  <br>
  <li>7: Diagonal moves are not allowed in this version of the game.</li>
  <br>
  <li>8: The game is considered successful if only one peg remains on the board in the end.</li>
  <br>
  <li>9: If you are stuck and cannot make any more valid moves, the game is over, and you have to restart.</li>
  <br>
  <li>10: The fewer pegs left on the board at the end, the better your performance in the game.</li>
