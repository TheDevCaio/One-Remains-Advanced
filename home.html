          <br>
          <li>2: Each match consists of exactly 6 rounds, ending immediately after the resolution of the 6th round.</li>
          <br>

          <br>
          <li>4: The player controls a location if the sum of the strengths of their characters at the location is greater than the sum of the opponent's characters also at the location.</li>
          <br>
          <li>5: Each player starts with a deck containing the same 12 character cards. Each card has a name, an energy cost, and a strength value.</li>

            <br>
            - A newly drawn card added to their hand;
            <br>
            - Total energy equal to the current round number (from 1 to 6).
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>8: The player can spend energy to place the cards from their hand on a valid location.</li>
          <br>
          <li>9: The player cannot place a card if they do not have enough energy to play it.</li>
          <br>
          <li>10: The player cannot place more than 4 cards at a location.</li>
          <br>
          <li>11: Unused energy is lost at the end of the round.</li>
          <br>
          <li>12: The winner will be the one who, at the end of the match, controls the majority of the 3 locations in dispute.</li>
